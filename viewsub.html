        <h2>ABSTRACT: </h2>
        <h3>A good idea for a graduate-level project would be exploring the applicability of project management while building a website. This would put students in touch with a team of backend developers and web designers where the job of a project manager would be to facilitate collaboration and functionality for both teams. Students looking to pursue a career in the IT industry would also gain practical knowledge in backend development.</h3>
